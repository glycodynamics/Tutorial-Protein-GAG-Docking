# Docking
This tutorial aims to dock glycans and glycosminoglycans to proteins using the [AutoDock Vina](https://vina.scripps.edu), [Vina-carb](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00834) and [GlycoTorch Vina](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00373)
You can download all the input files by clicking in Code --> Download Zip. Unzip this file and go inside docking directory. 
We will breakdown this tutorial in five steps.

## 1. Structure Preperation
## 2. Preperation of reseptor and ligand PDBQT files
## 3. Docking input files
## 4. Docking
## 5. Analyzing Docking Results
